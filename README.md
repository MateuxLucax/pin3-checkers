# JS Checkers

Projeto Integrador 3, UDESC 6Âª fase 2022/2

## Setting up the environment

This projects uses JS modules, which don't work if you just open the html files in a browser. So a local http server is needed. Here are some options:

### [NodeJS - Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

First, you will need to have NodeJS installed. You can follow [these instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) on how to install it on your device.
After NodeJS is installed and set up on your CLI path, simply run:

```bash
$ npx serve
```

### [Python http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)

To use python's built in http server, you just need to install Python3 ([instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). After installing it you just need to run the following command:

```bash
$ python3 -m http.server
```
